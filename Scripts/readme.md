## Scripts

Within this folder you will find some scripts that I created as part of my curriculum for Upenn.

- [This](https://github.com/jimcamp95/Project1/blob/main/Scripts/roulette_dealer_finder_by_time.sh) script was created with 2 variables that allows the user to input a specific time of day to find the name of a Roulette dealer that was working on that specific day
- [This](https://github.com/jimcamp95/Project1/blob/main/Scripts/roulette_dealer_finder_by_time_and_game.sh) script was created for the user to be able to find any dealer working by indicating the time and specfic casino game.
- [This](https://github.com/jimcamp95/Project1/blob/main/Scripts/system_info.sh) script was created to quickly figure out how much free memory is avalible on the system, disk usage, all open files, and file system disk space stats
