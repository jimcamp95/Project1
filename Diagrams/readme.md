## Cloud Network Diagram

Within this folder, you will find the network diagram map I created to give a visual representation of how the cloud network is set up.

Within the diagram it will show the following : 
- The Research Group
- The Virtual Network
- The Virtual Subnet
- The Network Security Group
- 3 Web VM's running DVWA
- 1 JumpBox VM to connect to those Web VM's
- An Elk-Stack Server recieving logs from the Web VMs
- 1 Load Balancer

The network diagram shows how all of these components are connected together.
